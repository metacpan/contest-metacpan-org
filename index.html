  <h1>MetaCPAN Logo Contest</h1>

  <p>MetaCPAN, a free and open search engine for the CPAN, is looking for a new
    logo to use in all MetaCPAN-related sites and programs.<p>

  <h2>Prize</h2>

  <p>The first prize will be <strong>US $400</strong>, generously provided by
    the <a href="http://www.enlightenedperl.org">Enlightened Perl
    Organisation</a>!</p>

  <h2>How to contend?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a logo in a scalable format. Make sure it still looks delicious
      as a 16px by 16px icon.</li>

    <li>Submit the logo to
      <a href="mailto:contest@metacpan.org">contest@metacpan.org</a> before
      January 13, 2012.</li>

    <li>???</li>

    <li>Profit!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What happens then?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We will put your logos on
      our <a href="http://entries.contest.metacpan.org">blog</a> and let
      everyone comment on it.</li>

    <li>You can re-submit the logo after you have received feedback from the
      blog. Re-submission is allowed as many times as you like.</li>

    <li>After the 13th of January 2012 we will not accept any more
      submissions.</li>

    <li>Everyone who has contributed to MetaCPAN can
    rank the logos at <a href="https://vote.metacpan.org/">https://vote.metacpan.org</a> and the most popular one will be selected.</li>

    <li>The winner will receive his/her prize and his/her name will be
      immortalised on the <em>Thank You</em> page of MetaCPAN!</li>

    <li>The logo will be printed / used and abused everywhere!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What is MetaCPAN?</h2>

  <p>MetaCPAN is a free, open search engine for
    the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, which is an ever growing
    archive of code and documentation for the Perl programming
    language. MetaCPAN is a community effort. On the surface, MetaCPAN enables
    the CPAN to be searched more easily. However, because MetaCPAN is driven by
    a free, open API, it encourages the incorporation of this data into many
    other projects.</p>

  <p>Essentially, there are two parts to MetaCPAN.

    <ol>
      <li>The public-facing <a href="http://metacpan.org">search engine</a></li>
      <li>The API, e.g.:
        <a href="http://api.metacpan.org/module/Moose">http://api.metacpan.org/module/Moose</a>
      </li>
    </ol>

  </p>

  <p>You can use and abuse the info you get from the API in any way you like. If
    you don't like the search engine, you can even use the API to build your own
    CPAN search. So, while the search site is the public face of MetaCPAN, its
    true value lies in an API which provides Perl hackers everywhere with the
    power to build their own complex search queries for extracting data from and
    about the CPAN.</p>

  <h2>What are we looking for?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Something clean and simple</li>

    <li>Works in both colour and black / white</li>

    <li>Not the same old camel, onion, book thing that all the other CPAN and
      Perl projects have</li>

    <li>A cool tagline will get bonus points</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rules</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Logo must be in the scalable <tt>SVG</tt> format.</li>

    <li>A proof-of-concept 16x16 version of the logo must be also sent
      in <tt>PNG</tt> format.</li>

    <li>Name the logo <tt>your_email-logoname-date.svg</tt> and
      <tt>your_email-logoname-date.png</tt>
      (i.e: <tt>rafl_debian_org-coolstuff-110923.svg</tt>).  Feel free to also
      include more variants of your logo, but the aforementioned two are
      required for the submission to be accepted.</li>

    <li>All files of your submission must be contained in a <tt>.zip</tt>
      or <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file that's named just like image files it contains,
      except with a different file extension.</li>

    <li>Logo must be submitted <em>before January 13, 2012</em>.</li>

    <li>You may submit as many logos as you wish.</li>

    <li>A license will be granted to the MetaCPAN team to use it in any way they
      see fit.</li>

    <li>We <em>won't</em> make any claims on non-winning entries.</li>

    <li>Potential taxes on the prize will be paid by the winner.</li>

    <li>The result of the contest can not be overruled or questioned.</li>

    <li>Olaf Alders, Clinton Gormley, and Moritz Onken will have veto.</li>
  </ul>
